#+TITLE: A bit of route spiking

** Usage
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   gem install bundler 
   bundle install --path .bundle
   ruby lib/server.rb
   #+END_SRC

** Experiment Results
   
These went pretty much as expected:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl localhost:4567/ -v
curl localhost:4567/foobar -v
curl localhost:4567/tea -v
curl localhost:4567/coffee -v
#+END_SRC

This one is messing with me though:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
curl -i -XPOST http\://localhost\:4567/form\?My\=Data -d "lalala"
#+END_SRC

First, without the "lalala" my server tells me =411=: it wants a content length. I thought this meant, I had to send =-d "Content-Length: 0"=, but no, "lalala" ends the server complaint.

Second, I can get a value for =params["My"]= yet I can't seem to loop through the keys. I only spent two pomodoros on this project (plus this README) so it's possible I just didn't remember how to write Ruby.
